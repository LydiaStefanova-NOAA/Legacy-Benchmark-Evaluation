for UGCS data...

first run mkvar.sh to get data from Chris's directory for GG data from the flx files
(run mkvar.one.sh to get data for just one variable from Chris's directory for GG data from the flx files)

first run mkvar1x1.sh to get data from Chris's directory for 1x1 data from the pgb files
(run mkvar1x1.one.sh to get data for just one variable from Chris's directory for 1x1 data from the pgb files)

rewrite.sh is for converting flux files forecast hour from accumulated to instantaneous

run mkcopygb.sh to copygb from T574 to T126 for the GG timeseries data

then run mkclimn.sh to make climos, only works for T126 now.
run mkindexclm.sh to make index of climo files: may not be necessary

Only if T574 climos are made:
run copygbclm.sh to copygb from T574 to T126 for the climo data
